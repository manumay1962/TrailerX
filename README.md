 # 🛠️ Built With
React JS — For building a fast, dynamic, and highly responsive UI that won’t leave you buffering (nobody likes buffering).

Redux Toolkit — Because keeping track of movie data without it would be like juggling popcorn in the dark.

React Router DOM — So you can hop from one movie page to another with ease, just like flicking through Netflix without the endless scrolling.

Vercel — For seamless and reliable deployment, making TrailerX accessible to everyone, everywhere.

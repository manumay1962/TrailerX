# TrailerX

TrailerX is a modern platform that lets users discover, browse, and watch the latest movie and TV show trailers. It offers a smooth, fast, and visually appealing experience with detailed actor profiles, powerful browsing capabilities.

 # 🛠️ Built With
React JS — For building a fast, dynamic, and highly responsive UI that won’t leave you buffering (nobody likes buffering).

Redux Toolkit — Because keeping track of movie data without it would be like juggling popcorn in the dark.

React Router DOM — So you can hop from one movie page to another with ease, just like flicking through Netflix without the endless scrolling.

Vercel — For seamless and reliable deployment, making TrailerX accessible to everyone, everywhere.

# API Used
TMDB API (The Movie Database) for fetching trailers, actor information, and movie/TV show data.
